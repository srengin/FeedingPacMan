# Name: 
Feeding PacMan

***

# Description: 
Once "Start Game" is pressed, PacMan appears on the screen. While he is constantly moving in whatever direction he faces, he does bounce off the walls and can be made to change directions (up, down, right or left) with the arrow keys. When the "Feed PacMan" button is pressed a pizza pops up out of no where and heads in a random direction at a random velocity. The pizza does bounce off the wall as well. An unlimited amount of pizzas can be produced to feed PacMan; they are stored in an array. When PacMan is in contact with the pizza he "eats" them and the number of pizzas he eats is displayed at the top.
